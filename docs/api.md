# API reference

Every route is under `/api`, takes and returns JSON, and fails with RFC 9457 problem details
(`application/problem+json`, with `trace_id`). Cookie sessions send `X-CSRF-Token` on unsafe methods; API keys send
`Authorization: Bearer exai_k1_…` and may pick a workspace with `X-Workspace: <id>`. Timestamps are epoch
milliseconds; days in usage reports are `YYYYMMDD` integers in queries and `YYYY-MM-DD` strings in answers. Labels
are `public < internal < confidential < restricted`.

Sprint 1 routes (`/api/auth/*`, `/api/me` profile, factors, API keys and sessions, `/api/admin/{identity-providers,
test-login, group-mappings, roles, users, sessions}`) are described in [identity.md](identity.md).

## Me (Sprint 2 additions)

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /me` | Now also returns `workspaces` (the ones the caller may use) and `workspace` (the current one) |
| `PUT /me/workspace` `{workspaceId}` | Switches the session's current workspace |
| `GET /me/notifications` | `{items: [{id, kind, title, body, route, label, createdAt, read}], email}` |
| `POST /me/notifications/read` `{ids?}` | Marks the given (or all) notifications read |
| `GET /me/jobs` | Jobs the caller started: `{id, type, state, progress, message, error, createdAt, finishedAt}` |
| `POST /me/jobs/:id/cancel` | Cancels one of them |

Socket events for the signed-in user: `notification` (a notification as above), `job.progress`
`{id, type, state, progress, message}`, `session.revoked`.

## Tenants and workspaces (`tenant:manage`)

A tenant admin works in their own tenant; system admins may act on any tenant. `:tid` is a tenant id.

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/tenants` | Tenants the caller may manage: `{id, slug, name, directoryDn, state, users, key: {kms, name, version, state}, quota, lastSync, workspaces: [workspace]}` |
| `GET /admin/tenants/:tid` | One tenant, same shape |
| `POST /admin/tenants` `{slug, name, directoryDn?}` | System admin: creates a tenant with a local user store and its data key |
| `PATCH /admin/tenants/:tid` `{name?, directoryDn?, state?: active\|disabled}` | Renames; only system admins change state (never their own tenant) |
| `POST /admin/tenants/:tid/offboard` `{confirm: <tenant name>}` | System admin: destroys the tenant key, revokes every session and key, queues the purge job. `202 {keyVersionsDestroyed, sessionsRevoked, apiKeysRevoked, jobId}` |
| `GET/PUT /admin/tenants/:tid/quota` | Tenant totals `{tokensPerDay, gpuSecondsPerMonth, trainingGpuHoursPerMonth}` (null = unlimited). PUT is system admin only |
| `GET /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces` | Workspaces including archived |
| `POST /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces` `{name, description?, labelCeiling, visibility: tenant\|members, mapping?: {group, role, clearance, providerId?}}` | Creates a workspace, optionally with its first group mapping |
| `PATCH /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces/:wid` `{name?, description?, labelCeiling?, visibility?, state?: active\|archived}` | Updates or archives |
| `GET /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces/:wid/members` | `{id, username, displayName, clearance, state, lastLoginAt, sources: [direct\|mapping], roles}` |
| `POST /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces/:wid/members` `{userId}` | Adds a direct member |
| `DELETE /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces/:wid/members/:uid` | Removes a direct membership |
| `GET/PUT /admin/tenants/:tid/workspaces/:wid/quota` | Workspace limits, capped by the tenant's |
| `POST /admin/authz/evaluate` `{userId, action, label?, zoneCeiling?}` | Explains the policy pipeline for a user: `{user, decision, steps: [{step, ok, detail}]}` |

A workspace is `{id, tenantId, name, slug, description, label, visibility, state, members, createdAt, updatedAt}`.
A quota view is `{scope, workspaceId, tokensPerDay, gpuSecondsPerMonth, trainingGpuHoursPerMonth, used: {tokensToday,
gpuSecondsMonth, trainingGpuHoursMonth}, resets: {daily, monthly}, updatedAt}`.

Group mappings (`/admin/group-mappings`, `identity:manage`) take an optional `workspaceId`; a mapping with a
workspace also makes the group's members members of it. `PATCH /admin/group-mappings/:id` edits one.
`POST /admin/identity-providers/:id/sync` runs directory sync for one store now (`202 {jobId}`).

Over quota, interactive requests fail with `429`, `Retry-After`, and `{limit, scope, used, max, resets_at,
raised_by}` in the problem.

## Usage (`usage:read`)

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/usage/summary?by=user\|model\|workspace\|profile\|tenant&days=14&from&to&workspace` | `{by, from, to, rows: [{key, name, prompt, output, thinking, calc, gpuMs, requests}]}`; `tenant` is for system admins |
| `GET /admin/usage/daily?days=14&workspace` | One entry per day: `[{day, tokens, gpuSeconds}]` |
| `GET /admin/quotas` | `{tenant: quota view, workspaces: [{id, name, label, ...quota view}]}` |
| `POST /admin/usage/exports` `{from?, to?, workspaceId?}` | Queues a usage CSV export (`202`, an export) |

## Audit (`audit:read`)

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/audit?kind&action&from&to&label&actor&limit&before` | Events, newest first; rows above the reader's clearance are redacted |
| `GET /admin/audit/summary` | `{head: {seq, hash, ts}, eventsToday, checkpoint, lastVerification, siem}` |
| `GET /admin/audit/:id` | One event plus `correctedBy: [{id, seq, ts}]` |
| `POST /admin/audit/verify` | Recomputes the chain and checks every signed checkpoint: `{status, checked, head, brokenAt?, checkpoints: {checked, failed}, lastGoodCheckpoint, notified}` |
| `GET/POST /admin/audit/checkpoints` | Lists, or signs the current head |
| `POST /admin/audit/:id/corrections` `{reason, correction}` | Appends a correction row (original actor or tenant admin) |
| `GET /admin/audit/stream` | SIEM stream status `{enabled, url, state, delivered, pending, dropped, lastDeliveredAt, lastError}` |
| `POST /admin/audit/exports` `{kind?, action?, from?, to?, label?, actor?, filtered}` | Queues a CSV export. Without `filtered`, a selection with rows above the caller's clearance fails `403 Export blocked` with `{total, above, clearance}` |
| `GET /admin/exports` | Exports (audit ones need `audit:read`, usage ones `usage:read`) |
| `GET /admin/exports/:id/download` | The CSV (logged to audit) |

An export is `{id, kind, file, scope, maxLabel, state: queued|running|ready|failed, rows, omitted, jobId, createdBy,
createdByName, createdAt}`.

## Ollama gateway (Sprint 3)

Pools, instances and the model catalogue are shared by every tenant; profiles belong to one. Pool routes need
`pools:manage`, catalogue changes `models:manage` (reading it `models:read`), profiles `profiles:manage`.

### Pools and instances

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/pools` | Live snapshot: pools with `placements` and `instances` (below) |
| `POST /admin/pools` `{name, accelerator: cuda\|rocm\|metal\|cpu, zone, labelCeiling, description?}` | Creates a pool |
| `PATCH /admin/pools/:id`, `DELETE /admin/pools/:id` | Edits; deletes an empty pool |
| `POST /admin/pools/:id/upgrade` `{targetVersion, waitMinutes}` | Rolling Ollama upgrade job (`202 {jobId}`): drains one instance at a time, waits for it to report the target version, reloads pinned models |
| `POST /admin/pools/:id/instances` `{name, url, deploy: docker\|baremetal, tls?: {caFile, certFile, keyFile}, settings}` | Registers an Ollama endpoint; `settings`: `memoryBytes, hardware, node, device, parallel, maxLoaded, numCtx, kvCacheType, keepAlive` |
| `PATCH /admin/instances/:id` `{url?, tls?, settings?, state?: active\|disabled}`, `DELETE /admin/instances/:id` | Edits, removes |
| `GET /admin/instances/:id/plan?model=<name>` | Memory planner: `{fits, resident, needBytes, freeBytes, evict: [names], reason}` |
| `GET /admin/instances/:id/events` | Load, unload, eviction and pull history `[{model, event, reason, actor, ts}]` ("why is this cold?") |
| `POST /admin/instances/:id/load` `{model, pinned}` | Loads (evicting warm models if the plan says so). `409 No spare memory` with `plan`; `429` with `limit: anti_thrash` |
| `POST /admin/instances/:id/unload` `{model}` | Unloads |
| `POST /admin/instances/:id/drain`, `POST /admin/instances/:id/undrain` | Stops routing, waits for requests, unloads; returns to service |

A snapshot instance: `{id, pool_id, name, url, deploy, settings, state, health: unknown|healthy|degraded|unreachable,
health_detail, version, last_seen_at, latencyMs, firstTokenMs, inflight, queued, parallel, memory: {totalBytes,
usedBytes, freeBytes}, loaded: [{name, sizeBytes, vramBytes, expiresAt, residency: pinned|warm|draining,
estimateBytes, drift}], loading: [names], available: [{name, sizeBytes, digest}]}`. The socket event `pools.state`
(to holders of `pools:manage`) says the snapshot changed.

### Placements

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /admin/placements` `{modelId, poolId, residency: pinned\|warm\|cold, pull: true}` | Places a model on a pool (refused when the model's label is above the pool's ceiling) and queues the pull (`jobId`) |
| `PATCH /admin/placements/:id` `{residency}`, `DELETE /admin/placements/:id` | Changes residency; removes |

### Model catalogue

Lifecycle: `draft → evaluated → approved → deprecated → retired`.

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/models` | Models with `pools: [{placementId, poolId, pool, residency}]` and `profiles` (count) |
| `POST /admin/models` `{name, source, expectedDigest?, license?: {name, url?, notes?}, label, notes?, poolId?}` | Import request. Pickle sources are refused (`422 Import refused`, `reason: pickle`); with `poolId` it is placed and pulled |
| `PATCH /admin/models/:id` `{license?, label?, notes?}` | Records the licence and so on |
| `POST /admin/models/:id/pull` `{poolId}` | Pulls again (job). A digest mismatch or a non-GGUF/safetensors format deletes the blob and fails the import |
| `POST /admin/models/:id/evaluate` | Conformance job: chat smoke test, and a tool-calling test for models claiming tools (failing it withholds tools). Passing moves draft → evaluated |
| `POST /admin/models/:id/lifecycle` `{to: approved\|deprecated\|retired, retireAt?, reason?}` | Approval needs an evaluation, a recorded licence and a second person (`403` with `step: dual-control` for the requester) |

A model: `{id, name, family, parameterSize, quantization, format, sizeBytes, contextLength, capabilities, source,
expectedDigest, digest, license, label, state, importState: pending|pulling|pulled|failed, importError, evaluation:
{at, instance, tests: [{name, ok, detail}], passed, total, toolsWithheld}, requestedBy, approvedBy, approvedAt,
retireAt, notes, createdAt, updatedAt}`.

### Profiles

| Method and path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/profiles` | Profiles with `model {id, name, state, label, capabilities, digest}`, `pool` (name), `canaryModel`, `residency: loaded\|cold\|unavailable\|none` |
| `POST /admin/profiles` `{name, displayName, aliasOf?, modelId?, poolId?, numCtx?, temperature?, thinkDefault?, thinkCeiling?, systemPrompt?, fallback?: {profileId, afterQueueWaitMs}, tools?: ['calculate'], label?, description?}` | Creates a draft (an alias is created published and only points at another profile) |
| `PATCH /admin/profiles/:id` (same fields, plus `note`) | Saves a new version |
| `POST /admin/profiles/:id/publish` `{status: published\|disabled\|draft}` | Publishing checks: approved model, placed on a pool cleared for the profile's label, thinking and tools supported |
| `PUT /admin/profiles/:id/canary` `{modelId, percent}`, `POST /admin/profiles/:id/canary/promote`, `DELETE /admin/profiles/:id/canary` | Canary rollout |
| `GET /admin/profiles/:id/versions`, `POST /admin/profiles/:id/rollback` `{version}` | History and rollback (as a new version) |
| `DELETE /admin/profiles/:id` | Refused while an alias or fallback points at it |

A profile: `{id, name, displayName, description, aliasOf, modelId, poolId, numCtx, temperature, thinkDefault,
thinkCeiling, systemPrompt, fallback, canary, tools, label, status, version, updatedAt}`.
