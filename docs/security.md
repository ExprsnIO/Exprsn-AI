# Security model

This page lists the controls in place as of Sprint 1 and what later sprints add. Report vulnerabilities privately to
the maintainers rather than in issues.

## Authentication

- Passwords are verified by the user store that owns the account; the application stores passwords only for local
  accounts (argon2id, OWASP parameters). SQL stores must hold argon2 or bcrypt hashes.
- LDAP: LDAPS or StartTLS with certificate verification (TLS 1.2+, optional private CA). Empty passwords are refused
  before any bind (they would be an unauthenticated bind). Filter values are escaped per RFC 4515.
- SQL stores: identifiers from configuration are validated as plain names and quoted; values are bound parameters.
- One password is never tried against a second store (see [identity.md](identity.md#chain-rules)); response time
  does not reveal whether an account exists.
- Lockout per account and per client address, shared across instances through the database.
- Second factors: TOTP with single use per time step and sealed seeds; WebAuthn passkeys with signature counters;
  recovery codes stored as HMACs. Admin roles require a verified factor for every admin request.

## Sessions and requests

- The browser holds only an opaque 256-bit token in a `__Host-` cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).
  The database stores its HMAC. Idle and absolute timeouts; the token is rotated when a second factor completes.
- State-changing requests need the session's CSRF token (HMAC-bound to the session) and, when present, a matching
  `Origin`. Socket.io connections are accepted only from the configured origin with a fully signed-in session.
- Revoking a session or disabling a user takes effect on the next request and closes live sockets.
- API keys are HMAC'd at rest, shown once, and never widen their owner's permissions.
- Helmet headers: strict CSP (`default-src 'self'`, no inline script, `frame-ancestors 'none'`), HSTS behind HTTPS,
  `no-referrer`, `nosniff`. JSON bodies are capped at 256 KB. Rate limits per user and per address.

## Authorisation

- One evaluator for every request: role → credential scopes → tenant → clearance → zone. Denials name the failing
  step and are audited.
- Tenant isolation: every repository method takes the tenant id from the principal; nothing reads a tenant from the
  request body.
- Grant rules prevent privilege escalation: only a system admin can grant system admin, roles can be granted only by
  the roles listed for them, clearance cannot be granted above the granter's own, and admins cannot change their own
  access.

## Audit

Per-tenant SHA-256 hash chain over canonical JSON (every field, including the previous hash). Rows are never updated
or deleted by the application; verification is read-only. Events above the reader's clearance are returned without
content. Sprint 2 adds signed checkpoints in write-once storage and streaming to a SIEM.

## Secrets

Configuration holds references (`env:`, `file:`), never values. The server reads secret files at use time. Container
and systemd deployments pass secrets as files (Docker secrets, systemd credentials), not environment variables.
Sprint 2 replaces `DATA_KEY` with a KMS (OpenBao transit) and per-tenant data keys.

## Deployment hardening

Container: non-root, read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, internal networks for
the database and Ollama. systemd: `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`, empty capability set, system-call
filter, private `/tmp`, only the state directory writable.

## Known gaps, tracked in the plan

- First-factor enrolment: an admin with no second factor enrols one at first sign-in, so until then the account is
  protected by its password alone. Have new admins sign in and enrol promptly; an identity admin can reset factors
  (which forces re-enrolment) if an account may have been enrolled by someone else.
- Kerberos SPNEGO, OIDC/SAML federation and device flow: Sprint 9.
- Directory sync that disables users removed from every mapped group between sign-ins: Sprint 2. Until then, removal
  from a group takes effect at the user's next sign-in; disable the user in the console to act immediately.
- Multi-instance Socket.io fan-out (Redis adapter): Sprint 2. Until then run one instance, or pin sessions.
- Screens still showing prototype data change nothing on the server; their APIs arrive in the sprint shown on each.
