# Sprints

Two-week sprints that turn the [design prototype](design/prototype/README.md) into the production application.
Architecture decisions and the rules every sprint follows are in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). A console screen moves
from prototype data to live only when every control on it is backed by the server; until then it shows the
"Prototype data" banner with the sprint number below (set in the `NAV` table in `web/js/app.js`).

Current codebase: every sidebar screen except Training, Zones, Platform and Identity is live (Sign in, Settings, User
stores, Tenants, Usage and audit, Models, Pools, Profiles, Chat, Compare, Guardrails, Flags, Classifiers, Knowledge,
Memory, Connections, Registry, MCP servers, Runs, Scripts, Workflows, Media and Images); eight database migrations
(`001_core` to `008_workflows`); 219 unit and API tests (against a fake Ollama, a fake MCP server and fake script,
media and image runners) plus the integration suite against PostgreSQL, MySQL, OpenLDAP and Redis.

---

## Sprint 0: Foundations (done)

Delivered in `server/`, `deploy/` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- npm workspaces; TypeScript strict, ESLint, Vitest.
- zod-validated configuration (`server/src/config`) with `*_FILE` variants for secrets.
- Express 5 with Helmet (strict CSP, HSTS behind HTTPS), compression, per-user and per-address rate limits, W3C trace
  ids, RFC 9457 problem+json errors, pino logs with redaction.
- `/healthz`, `/readyz` (database and migrations), `/metrics` (Prometheus, token-protected).
- Knex for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite with the core migration (tenants, workspaces, identity providers, users and
  identities, local credentials, group mappings, roles, sessions, API keys, second factors, login throttle, audit).
- Socket.io on the same server with the cookie-session handshake; graceful shutdown.
- `exprsn-ai` CLI: `migrate`, `admin:create`, `audit:verify`.
- Dockerfile; Compose for production (app, PostgreSQL, Ollama on internal networks), development (seeded OpenLDAP,
  PostgreSQL and MySQL user stores) and GPU; systemd unit and installer for bare metal.
- CI: lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, console parse check; integration job against real PostgreSQL, MySQL and
  OpenLDAP; container image job that must answer `/readyz`.

## Sprint 1: Identity and access (done)

Delivered in `server/src/identity`, `server/src/authz`, `server/src/audit`, `server/src/routes` and the live console
screens `signin.js`, `settings.js` and `directories.js`. Details in [docs/identity.md](docs/identity.md) and
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

- User-store adapters: OpenLDAP (service bind → search → user bind → groups; RFC 4515 escaping; empty passwords
  refused; LDAPS/StartTLS required outside development), SQL user tables on PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite
  (configurable columns and group sources; argon2 and bcrypt only; bound parameters), and local accounts.
- Ordered chain per tenant: unknown user → next store; wrong password in the owning store → stop; broken store →
  skipped and reported; equal timing when no store knows the user. Stores can also be declared in the identity YAML
  (`IDENTITY_CONFIG`) and are then managed by config.
- Just-in-time provisioning keyed on (store, external id); a username already linked to another store is refused.
  Group mappings give the union of roles and the highest clearance; stores without groups may grant default
  (non-admin) roles.
- Sessions: opaque cookie token, HMAC'd at rest, `__Host-` httpOnly SameSite=Strict, idle and absolute timeouts, token
  rotation when a second factor completes; CSRF double-submit bound to the session; Origin checks.
- Second factors: TOTP (single use per time step), WebAuthn passkeys, recovery codes. Admin roles must enrol at first
  sign-in and cannot use admin routes without a verified factor.
- Lockout per account and per address, stored in the database so every instance shares it.
- API keys `exai_k1_…`: shown once, HMAC'd, scoped to a subset of the owner's permissions and re-intersected on every
  request; revoked with the owner's disablement.
- The 13 built-in roles and grant rules (only a system admin grants system admin; admins cannot change their own
  access); one policy pipeline (role → scopes → tenant → clearance → zone ceiling).
- Audit hash chain with verification, and clearance redaction when reading it.
- API: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/me/*`, `/api/admin/{identity-providers, test-login, group-mappings, roles, users,
  sessions, audit}`.
- Console: **Sign in** (password, second factor, first-time enrolment), **Settings** (profile, appearance, factors,
  API keys, sessions) and the new **User stores** screen (stores: add, edit, order, enable, test connection; group
  mappings; users: roles, clearance, disable, reset factors, local accounts; sessions: revoke; "Test a login").

Carried forward to Sprint 2 (and delivered there): directory sync, the Socket.io Redis adapter, and replacing
`DATA_KEY` with the KMS.

## Sprint 2: Tenancy, audit and platform services (done)

Delivered in `server/src/platform`, `server/src/tenancy`, `server/src/audit`, `server/src/identity/sync.ts`,
`server/src/routes/admin/{tenants,usage,audit}.ts` and the live console screens `tenants.js` and `usage-audit.js`.
API in [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).

- Tenants and workspaces: system admins create, rename, disable and offboard tenants; tenant admins create, edit and
  archive workspaces (label ceiling, tenant-wide or members-only), add and remove members, and map directory groups
  to a workspace. The shell's workspace switcher stores the choice in the session (`X-Workspace` for API keys).
- Quotas per tenant and per workspace (tokens per day, GPU-seconds per month, training GPU-hours per month), nested
  under the tenant's, enforced on every chat and compare request with `429`, `Retry-After` and a problem naming the
  limit and who can raise it. Usage is metered per tenant, workspace, user, model and profile.
- Usage and audit: usage by user, model, workspace, profile and tenant; daily tokens; audit filters (kind, action,
  actor, label, time); the full event; chain verification against signed checkpoints (KMS HMAC, copy in the blob
  store; hourly and on demand) with notification of tenant admins and auditors when it breaks; corrections as linked
  rows; CSV exports produced by a job, sealed, never above the requester's clearance (blocked with the count, or
  filtered); the SIEM stream (NDJSON over HTTPS).
- `Kms` with local and OpenBao transit adapters and per-tenant envelope data keys: versioned, rotatable
  (`exprsn-ai kms:rotate`), destroyed at offboarding with every instance dropping cached copies. TOTP seeds moved from
  `DATA_KEY` to the platform data key (older seeds still open).
- `BlobStore` (filesystem, and S3-compatible with SigV4 over fetch); `JobQueue` (database polling, or BullMQ on
  Redis) with retries, cancellation, stale-lock recovery and progress pushed to the submitter's sockets; a
  deduplicating scheduler so several instances enqueue a recurring job once.
- Notifications stored per user, pushed over the socket (the console's bell), and emailed over SMTP when configured.
- Redis: the Socket.io adapter and a cross-instance bus (session revocation, job cancellation, chat stop,
  notifications), so several instances can run behind a load balancer.
- Directory sync (hourly by default, or on demand per store): disables users removed from the store or from every
  mapped group and revokes their sessions and keys, refreshes roles, workspaces and clearance for the rest, never
  disables anyone when the store cannot be read, and stops if a run would disable more than half of a store's users.
- Offboarding in three steps: export, destroy the tenant key, then a purge job for conversations, attachments,
  exports and notifications (the audit chain and usage stay); the tenant ends `offboarded` and cannot be re-enabled.
- `/readyz` also checks the KMS and the blob store; the effective-permission explainer
  (`POST /api/admin/authz/evaluate`) shows every step of the policy for a user.

**Done when:** a tenant admin can create a workspace, set a quota and watch a request get 429; an auditor can verify
the chain and export only what their clearance allows. Both are covered by tests (`tenancy.test.ts`,
`chat.test.ts`).

## Sprint 3: Ollama gateway, models, pools, profiles (done)

Delivered in `server/src/gateway`, `server/src/routes/admin/gateway.ts` and the live console screens `models.js`,
`pools.js` and `profiles.js`.

- Pools (accelerator, zone, label ceiling) and instances for Docker and bare-metal Ollama, with optional mutual TLS
  (CA, client certificate and key per instance) and the node's settings (memory, parallel requests, maximum loaded
  models, context, KV cache type, keep-alive).
- A poller of `/api/version`, `/api/ps` and `/api/tags` (every 5 s by default) keeping health (healthy, degraded,
  unreachable), versions, residency and what is pulled, and recording models that disappear without an unload as
  evicted; `pools.state` socket updates for the Pools screen.
- Load, pin, unload and drain through `keep_alive`; a memory planner (fits, fits after evicting warm models, never
  evicts pinned ones) and estimate drift against measured memory; an anti-thrash limit of loads per instance per ten
  minutes; slot accounting per instance with a queue (and the caller's place in it); load and eviction history
  ("why is this cold?").
- The model catalogue with lifecycle draft → evaluated → approved → deprecated → retired: import requests (pickle
  sources refused), pulls by job with progress, digest verification against the digest pinned in the request (the
  blob is deleted on a mismatch), GGUF/safetensors only, a conformance run (chat smoke test and tool calling;
  failing tool calling withholds tools), a recorded licence, and dual-control approval. Retiring removes a model
  from routing.
- Placements of models on pools with residency (pinned, warm, cold), refused above the pool's label ceiling.
- Profiles per tenant: model, pool, `num_ctx`, temperature, system prompt, thinking default and ceiling, a fallback
  chain after a queue wait, the built-in calculate tool, a label, aliases, a canary share of requests to another
  approved model (promote or stop), and every change as a version with rollback. Publishing checks the model's
  approval and capabilities and that a pool cleared for the profile's label runs it.
- Rolling Ollama upgrade by job: one instance at a time is drained, waited for until it reports the target version,
  given back its pinned models and returned to service.

**Done when:** a model admin approves a model, places it on a pool, and a profile routes to it (`gateway.test.ts`).

## Sprint 4: Chat, compare, metering (done)

Delivered in `server/src/chat`, `server/src/routes/chat.ts` and the live console screens `chat.js` and `compare.js`.

- Conversations as message trees (edits and regenerations are branches; the head is the leaf being viewed), scoped to
  the author and the current workspace; titles, content, thinking and calculation steps sealed with the tenant key.
- The profile picker lists published profiles the user is cleared for; a conversation's label (a high-water mark,
  raised by attachments) must not exceed the profile's label.
- Token streaming over Socket.io with per-message sequence numbers; `chat.status` (queued with position, loading
  on a cold start, fallback, streaming) and `chat.done` with usage; catch-up and resume through the stream endpoint.
- Stop (partial answers kept and metered by estimate), regenerate (optionally with another profile or thinking
  level), edit, and branch switching.
- Thinking levels capped by the profile's ceiling, streamed separately from the answer.
- Attachments: raw upload into sealed quarantine, a scan job (type detected from the bytes, ClamAV when configured,
  classification for payment cards, IBANs, national identifiers, emails and phone numbers), then ready or rejected;
  text is given to the model as labelled context, images to vision models.
- Usage recorded once per answer on the final chunk (prompt, output and thinking tokens, calculator calls,
  GPU-milliseconds); quotas checked before every request.
- Compare: one prompt to 2–4 profiles in parallel, each column streamed, stoppable, regenerable and metered on its
  own.
- The exact-calculation worker: a rational-arithmetic evaluator in a worker thread with memory and time limits,
  offered to models as the `calculate` tool and at `POST /api/calculate`.

Guardrails on prompts and answers arrived in Sprint 5, and knowledge, memory and tool bindings in chat in Sprints 6
and 7. Still open (see `docs/security.md`, known gaps): continuing a stream on another instance after the serving
instance stops.

## Sprint 5: Guardrails, classifiers, flags (done)

Delivered in `server/src/guardrails`, `server/src/routes/guardrails.ts` and the live console screens `guardrails.js`,
`flags.js` and `classifiers.js`.

- The checkpoint seam `s.guardrails.check` behind every feature, over the eleven checkpoints. Published rule sets apply
  in the order platform baseline, tenant, workspace, agent; the most restrictive enforced finding wins, and a tenant
  cannot relax a baseline rule.
- Mechanisms: RE2 patterns (an invalid pattern is reported with its position, the message and an equivalent), PII and
  secrets detectors with checksums and entropy, label checks, budgets, allow-lists, checkpoint facts, classifiers with
  thresholds, and the guard model through the gateway. Actions allow, log, warn, flag, redact, require-approval, block.
- Shadow and enforce (shadow never changes the outcome and a sample of its findings is flagged); fail closed per
  rule's onError, with confidential and tool-calling turns held and every fail-open decision flagged.
- Versioned rule sets: drafts edited in a form or as YAML, diff, withdraw, publish; the platform baseline publishes
  only when a second platform guardrail admin approves; live test of a rule on sample text (spans and score); shadow
  replay of a draft over recorded, sealed inputs as a job; promotion to enforce refused above a 10% false-positive rate.
- Classifiers: deterministic, trained linear, guard-model and LLM engines in one registry, thresholds, a synchronous
  classify endpoint, evaluation and training jobs with precision and recall per tenant, labelled cases (sealed),
  publishing gated on 200 samples per label, tenant names for the four levels.
- The flag queue: SLA timers by severity with a breach notice, clearance redaction (reassign only above clearance),
  confirm into an eval case, dismiss as a false positive, escalate, reassign, send to eval set, user reports, live
  updates over the socket.
- Chat checks user input before sending (block refuses, redact stores and sends the redacted text) and model output
  on the finished answer (block replaces the answer with a notice, redact replaces the spans, flags are raised).

**Done when:** a secret in a prompt is refused with the rule named, a PII rule redacts the prompt before the model sees
it, an unsafe answer judged by the guard model is withheld, a confidential turn is held while the guard model is down,
and a reviewer confirms a flag into an eval case from the queue (`guardrails.test.ts`).

## Sprint 6: Knowledge, memory, connections (done)

Delivered in `server/src/knowledge`, `server/src/memory`, `server/src/connections`, `server/src/platform/vectors.ts`,
`server/src/chat/context.ts`, `server/src/routes/{knowledge,memory}.ts`, `server/src/routes/admin/connections.ts`,
migration `006_knowledge` and the live console screens `knowledge.js`, `memory.js` and `connections.js`.

- Knowledge bases with a label floor, workspace scope and sharing (members or curators only; grants to workspaces,
  users and profiles); draft and published, and only published bases are used in chat.
- Sources: upload (sealed quarantine, type from the bytes, ClamAV when configured, classification), S3 prefixes with
  the platform's credentials, Git repositories over https (shallow clone by job), and PostgreSQL views through a data
  connection's allow-list, synced by watermark; unchanged documents skipped by version or content hash; schedules.
- Extraction (text, Markdown, CSV, JSON, HTML, DOCX, PDF text layer) and structure-aware chunking with headings as
  metadata; embeddings through the gateway, cached by content hash for 30 days.
- `VectorStore`: a table scan in the database, or pgvector on PostgreSQL when the extension is available.
- Hybrid search (vector plus BM25 over keyed-hash terms) fused with reciprocal rank fusion and optional model
  reranking, with the clearance filter inside every query; blue/green reindex by job with an atomic switch and
  cancel; relabelling never below the classifier's finding.
- Chat: published bases attached to a conversation or profile add labelled, delimited context through the `context`
  checkpoint, raise the conversation label and record sealed citations; accepted memories are included.
- Memory: user and workspace scopes (members propose, curators accept), agent memories, proposals extracted after
  each answer, the `memory` checkpoint on write and read (restricted and credentials refused), versions, expiry and an
  hourly purge, forget across every backend with audit, export by job.
- Data connections for PostgreSQL and OpenSearch: sealed credentials, test (a read-only account is checked), schema
  introspection and allow-lists, query classification (writes, DDL, several statements, objects and functions
  outside the allow-list refused; unparsed syntax only after confirmation), the `db-query` checkpoint, read-only
  transaction, row caps, statement timeouts, PII masking, CSV export through the `export` checkpoint; every query
  audited.

**Done when:** a curator builds a knowledge base from an upload, S3, Git or a Postgres view, reindexes it with another
embedding model while it keeps serving, and a chat answer cites its chunks only up to the reader's clearance; a user
accepts, edits, exports and forgets memories; a connection admin browses an allow-listed view read-only and every
refused write is audited (`knowledge.test.ts`, `memory.test.ts`, `connections.test.ts`).

## Sprint 7: Registry, MCP servers, runs, scripts (done)

Delivered in `server/src/registry`, `server/src/mcp`, `server/src/agents`, `server/src/scripts`, the routes
`routes/admin/registry.ts`, `routes/admin/mcp.ts`, `routes/agents.ts`, `routes/scripts.ts`, migration `007_registry`
and the live console screens `registry.js`, `mcp-servers.js`, `runs.js` and `scripts.js`.

- Registry entries (tools, skills, agents): draft → in review → published → deprecated → retired (and restore), versions,
  JSON Schema input and output, side-effect class, label ceiling, automated checks (required fields, schema validity,
  description quality, side effect declared, secrets scan, referenced tools published, limits), review by a tool admin
  other than the author, publish scope (tenant or named workspaces under their ceiling), and a test harness. The
  built-in `calculate` is a published platform tool.
- MCP servers over streamable HTTP (JSON and SSE responses, sessions, pagination) on internal hosts only: DNS resolved
  and every address checked at registration and on each connection, with `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for exceptions. Tools are
  hashed and wait for review; a polling job disables approved tools whose schema changes until they are re-approved.
  Service credentials and per-user vault tokens are sealed and never returned or shown to models.
- One tool dispatcher for chat, agents and the harness: argument validation, label ceiling, rate limit, the
  `tool-call` guardrail checkpoint, approval for write and destructive calls, output schema check.
- Agent runs as jobs with think/do/calc lanes, approvals that pause and resume the run, budgets (steps, tokens, wall
  time, tool calls) with raise-and-resume, a checkpoint after every step, replay from any checkpoint, cancel, live
  steps over Socket.io, and metering.
- Scripts: versions sealed at rest, the `script` guardrail checkpoint, blocked-module and secrets checks, runs as jobs
  through a `ScriptRunner` (docker or podman with no network, read-only root, non-root user, dropped capabilities,
  memory/CPU/pids/time/output limits; a fake runner for tests), promotion draft → tested → registry tool.
- Chat: profiles may bind published registry and MCP tools; read-only tools that need no confirmation are offered in
  chat through the dispatcher.

**Done when:** a script can be promoted to a tool, reviewed by a second tool admin and published; an MCP tool whose
schema changes is disabled until re-approved; and an agent run pauses for approval of a write call, resumes, and can
be replayed from a checkpoint (`registry.test.ts`, `mcp.test.ts`, `agents.test.ts`, `scripts.test.ts`).

## Sprint 8: Workflows, media, images (done)

Delivered in `server/src/workflows`, `server/src/media`, `server/src/images`, `server/src/routes/{workflows,media,images}.ts`
(migration `008_workflows`) and the live console screens `workflows.js`, `media.js` and `images.js`.

- Workflow graphs with typed ports, a draft (revisioned, 409 on a stale save) and published versions; publish
  validation that points at the step and edge: one trigger, acyclic, port schemas along every edge, label ceilings
  along every path (profiles' labels included), 40 steps, fan-out 10, 30 min per step, 2 h and 200k tokens per run,
  template references to upstream steps only.
- Step kinds: trigger, model (a published profile through the gateway, metered, quota-admitted), transform, branch,
  guardrail check (block fails, redact passes on, require-approval pauses), approval (role, timeout, data shown),
  HTTP to internal addresses only (never link-local or public, host not templated), calculate, wait, and tool.
- Durable execution as jobs: each step's output checkpointed sealed with the tenant key; after a restart a run resumes
  after its last checkpoint without re-running completed steps; approvals and waits pause without holding a worker;
  expired approvals fail the run; cancel.
- Dry runs of the draft (models and HTTP mocked, nothing metered, the owner decides approvals); replay from any step
  reusing upstream checkpoints; run history and live `workflow.run` / `workflow.step` socket events.
- Media: uploads streamed into sealed quarantine, containers recognised from their bytes, ffprobe caps (duration,
  resolution, streams, size) enforced before any processing, metadata stripped, previews drawn; presets
  (`clip-720p`, `transcribe-srt`, `frames-1fps`, `normalise-audio`) as typed parameter schemas that build argument
  arrays (no shell, no free-form options); NVENC with a CPU fallback; jobs with progress; sealed outputs; frames through
  the image-safety classifier and transcripts through the `media` checkpoint. `MediaRunner` has the ffmpeg-process
  adapter and a test fake.
- Images: `ImageBackend` with ComfyUI and diffusers-style HTTP adapters and a test fake; the `image` checkpoint on the
  prompt; GPU-second quota admission and metering; a safety classifier on the output (unsafe images discarded, still
  metered, audited, raised to reviewers); a KMS-signed provenance manifest in the PNG and beside it; images sealed at
  rest; send to chat as an attachment.

**Done when:** a workflow with a model step, a branch and an approval publishes, runs, pauses for the approver, resumes
after an instance restart without repeating steps, and replays from a step; a clip is probed, refused above a cap or
processed by a preset with progress; an image is generated, classified, signed, sealed and metered in GPU-seconds
(`workflows.test.ts`, `media.test.ts`, `images.test.ts`).

### Links between Sprints 5 to 8

Sprints 5 to 8 were built side by side against one guardrail seam (`server/src/guardrails/types.ts`,
`s.guardrails.check`), then connected:

- Workflow tool steps call published registry and MCP tools through the dispatcher (argument schema, `tool-call`
  checkpoint, rate limit); a write tool runs only after an approval step on every path, or pauses the run for one.
- A published workflow can be published as a registry tool (`impl: 'workflow'`, pinned to its version, reviewed like
  any tool); calling it runs the workflow within five minutes and returns its output. Workflows cannot call workflow
  tools.
- A media transcript can be sent to a knowledge base the user curates, keeping its label.
- Chat has a knowledge picker per conversation, `[n]` citation markers and a Sources list under each answer.
- Agent runs read the agent's accepted memories through the `memory` checkpoint.

## Sprint 9: Training, zones, platform, federation (next)

Training jobs (datasets with PII scrub, approval for confidential data, windows, checkpoints, evals, GGUF conversion to
a registry draft); zones (definitions, ceilings, draft and approve, rendered Compose and firewall configuration);
platform (signed import bundles, mirrors, ACME certificates, backups and restore drills); the Identity screen: OIDC
provider (ES256 JWKS, key rotation, clients), SAML IdP, upstream OIDC/SAML federation, Kerberos SPNEGO and device flow.

## Sprint 10: Hardening and release

OWASP ASVS level 2 review; dependency scanning and SBOM; load test of the streaming path; Helm chart and
NetworkPolicies; backup, restore and incident runbooks; accessibility (AA and AAA modes); a Playwright suite across
every screen; the 1.0 release.
